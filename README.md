# Anime Tracker Web App

## Overview

Anime Tracker is a modern, anime-inspired web application that allows users to track their favorite anime series. Users can search for anime, add new anime manually, categorize them as "Watching", "Completed", or "Plan to Watch", and view real anime data fetched from the Jikan API. The app also features a dark mode toggle and smooth, anime-inspired styling.

This project is perfect for showcasing front-end development skills, React proficiency, and working with APIs.
